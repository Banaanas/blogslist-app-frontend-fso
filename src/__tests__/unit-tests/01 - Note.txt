/** TESTS FOLDER **/

These Tests were build for the previous version of the BlogsList App.
Because the Components they are related to are not used anymore,
these Tests are no longer relevant.

HOWEVER, they were kept here as an example of what can be done with Jest and
React Testing Library.

They were heavily inspired from Part 5 of the FullStackOpen Course (2020) :
https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5.

IMPORTANT : Using data-testid query should ALWAYS be preferred over other selectors
whenever it is possible.
