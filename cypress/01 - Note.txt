/** CYPRESS FOLDER **/

Those Cypress Tests were build for the previous version of the BlogsList App.
Because the Component they are related to (Blog.js) is not used anymore,
these Tests are no longer relevant.

HOWEVER, these Tests are kept here as an example of what can be done with
Cypress.

They were heavily inspired from Part 5 of the FullStackOpen Course (2020) :
https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5.

NB: This Note also applies to React Testing Library (src/tests)
